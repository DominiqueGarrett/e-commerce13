## Description
This project is the creation of the back end for an e-commerce site. This application used Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application displays creation of database using mySQL with models and associations. Then demonstrates the API Routes to perform RESTful CRUD operations displayed in my walk through videos.


## User Story
    AS A manager at an internet retail company
    I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
    SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


## Acceptance Criteria 
    GIVEN a functional Express.js API
    WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
    THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
    WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
    THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
